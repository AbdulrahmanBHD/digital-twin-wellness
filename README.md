# digital-twin-wellness
A Computer Science project involving the following research topics: Digital Twins, Machine Learning, Health Technology

### Introduction

What if we build a digital reconstruction of you? with as many data points as possible. Like a mirror of you, it is constantly updated with your data and abstracted into a single entity, which is the mirror "digital twin" of yourself. This is a cutting edge research subject at the frontier of AI, Data Science, VR/XR and simulations. It is highly multi-disciplinary and applicable across various scenarios, enabling new levels of simulations and predictions.

In this project, we will test this concept for predicting your wellness score.
### What if with the seamless data collection of today, you can know how well you're going to feel / be productive tomorrow?
Let's see.

### Overview
Problem: Predict tomorrow’s wellness/productivity score (0–100) from today’s lifestyle signals.

Why it matters: Digital twins in healthcare are revolutionary, allowing for greater safety and insight into human medicine and health.

We'll use inputs commonly found from healthcare tracking gadgets nowadays.

Inputs (features): steps, movement_mins, calories, diet_qlt, water_l, sleep_mins, sleep_qlt, stress_avg, mood_entry_avg, coffee_mg, prod_mins, screen_mins, resting_hr_avg, 

Target: tmrw_wellness (0-100)

Success: R² ≥ 0.60 and MAE ≤ 8 on held-out set; clear feature importance; actionable insights.

Ethics: synthetic data; no medical claims.
